# Assignment 2: DEG Classification Workflow

## Overview:

  -Defined a function to classify genes based on logFC and padj

  -Handled missing padj values by replacing them with 1
  -Processed two DEG files and saved results

 ## Files:
  -class_II_DEG_classification.R = R script for DEG classification
  -raw_data = DEGs_Data_1.csv, raw_data/DEGs_Data_2.csv – Original DEG datasets
  -results = Processed_DEGs_Data_1.csv, results/Processed_DEGs_Data_2.csv – Processed outputs with classification

## Tools Used

- **R**
- **RStudio**
